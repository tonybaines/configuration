Configuration
=============

What do I want from a configuration framework?

* Strongly typed
    * automatic conversion to the expected type
* Hierarchical
* Support for defaults
* Dynamic updates
    * when backend values change, consumers get the latest value
* Changes can be persisted
* Different back-end storage
    * Files, database, URLs
* Config can be merged from different sources
    * e.g. Database, overridden by system-level file, overridden by per-user file
